# Advent of Code (2015-2022)

Python solutions to Code Advent problems.
There are only solutions for 2022, still.

I intend to publish the solutions in other languages, such as Java and Delphi

Check out https://adventofcode.com.

On each Day, there is the "input.txt" file, which is the main input to resolve.
There is "input2.txt" too, which is the example given in the description.

Thanks to https://github.com/encse/adventofcode where I copied the README.md files for each day.

I recommend you visit his GITHUB and give him a star.
